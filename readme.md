## who can use Cypress -

##  Cypress EcoSystem

1. Test Runner (Cypress App) - Install Locally (Open Source)

2. DashBoard - record the test (Paid)

## Feature

### 1.  Time Travel : 
 Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.

### 2. Debuggability :
Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.


### 3. Automatic waits (built in wait) :
Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.

### 4. Consistent Result:

Our architecture doesn't use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.

### 4. Screenshots, Videos, and Test Replay: 

View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos, if enabled, of your entire test suite when run from the CLI. Record to Cypress Cloud and replay the test as it executed during the run for zero-configuration debugging using Test Replay.


### 5. Cross Browser Testing: 

Run the test case in multiple browser which Cypress will going to support.


## Limitations

### 1. Can't automate window based/ Mobile application. (Same with Selinium)

### 2. Limited Browser Support

### 3. Limited Language Support(Only JS/TS) 

### 4. Reading/ Writing data into files is difficult

### 5. Third Party reporting tool is also limited.
